Welcome! My name is Brenden Harrell. I am a Lutheran Pastor and you have stubbled upon an experiment of mine. I have grown increasingly dissatisfied with the exhausting, overwhelming and overstimulating digital spaces we inhabit. Content is constantly being pushed on us or marketed to us in new shiny wrappers. 

My hope is that this site will be more like a little quiet wilderness. A place to slow down, explore, start conversations, and collaborate. Hence the name: *The Aspen Grove*.

Aspen trees never used to mean much to me. I'd look out into the forest and see an unformed mass of green and brown. Until one day, a memory was frozen into my sixteen year old brain. 

I was sixteen - old enough to be confident I understood the world - and young enough to believe it.  

I was on the epic adventure of boy scouting: backpacking in the back country of New Mexico. We hiked up and down the mountains of the Philmont reservation carrying everything we needed on our backs. On this particular day, we had hiked from the early light of dawn until we saw the vague pillars of trees pass us by with the extinguishing of the sun. Finally, flashlights bobbed and dropped as we fumbled to set up out tents in the dark. As if the dark was not complicated enough, a cool stormy breeze began to blow. The exhausted frantic shuffle ensued to erect our tents before the coming rain. I remember zipping the tent's door as a boom of thunder echoed against the mountain's heavy sides. That night can only be described as breath taking. The rumbles shook the ground I laid on while the wind whipped the trees. 

I woke the next morning to the soft bubble of a stream I hadn't noticed the night before. As I emerged from my little burrow, I stepped into the middle of a perfectly untouched aspen grove. The calm completely captivated me. Cream trunks surrounded us in every direction with the little creek winding its way past. The light softly filtered through bright green leaves as if the storm the night before was only a dream. 

At that moment, aspen trees began to mean something to me. But the funny thing about aspens is that no aspen tree is alone. Under the surface, all those individual trees are growing together as one. Each connected to the other by the roots.

# Connected by the Roots

Just like that aspen grove way up in the rocky mountains, you have stumbled on my digital aspen grove of thoughts, ideas, concepts, notes and experiences. 

It‚Äôs a little like a blog, but also very different. The basic concept of this site was inspired by the idea of [[Digital Gardening]]. The main idea of digital gardening is to create a space to plant ideas and let them grow gradually.  Rather than posting content that gets sent off into the torrent of data around us, a garden looks at a note as something meant to be revisited and edited and expanded.  

In other words, this is not a chronological feed of writings but is a living network of notes I have gathered and am writing about things that I find interesting and useful. 

I think the reason this concept resonates with me so much is that it mirrors my lived experience of thinking and developing ideas. No idea is at its best the first time you scribble it down. But if I take time to think about it and connect it with other things I have learned, a small idea can grow into something I never expected.   

Therefore the nature of this grove can be summarized in the following points:

- **No note is finished.** This follows [[The Iterative Nature of Learning]]. I have added clues to the start of notes to help you see how I view them and if I have put much work into them or not. you can read more details about that here:  [[The Organization of My Digital Garden]]

- **Notes are interconnected**. This allows for [[Topological Navigation]] by using links that connect related ideas together. This allows for navigation around the garden by following paths of ideas.  

By structuring this site according to these concepts it allows for a different way of ‚ÄúBeing‚Äù in digital space compared to stream based spaces like email, social media or blogs

# Christian Collaboration
Pastors and churches have a hard time collaborating in meaningful and open ways.

I‚Äôm not selling anything, and I don‚Äôt want to be an influencer. 

We often get stuck in [[The Packaging Trap]] which is basically always trying to market a new curriculum, or book, or journal that should just be copy pasted into a new context. Which we all know does not work. Curriculums end up being more work than just doing something yourself most of the time. 

So the desire of this garden is to be a space to explore collaboration that is more fluid and immediately useful for myself but also to visitors who use this garden as a resource. 

There is nothing to sell or package or advertised, just a humble offering of ideas and concepts that are useful to me and maybe will be useful to someone else too.

Starting conversations is far more important that publishing yet another book.
