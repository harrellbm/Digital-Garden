Pastor Brenden's 🌱🪴🌳 Digital Garden

start with the story of camping in an aspen grove 

metaphor of them all being connected by their root systme

problem of pastors and churches not colaborating in meaningful an open ways

desire of this garden to be a space to explore that kind of collaboration

description of my notes and the incomplete 
- iterative nature of them 
- topological nature of them through links forming paths
- This is a different way of "Being" in digital space compared to stream based spaces like email, social media or blogs


Description of how to use this garden as a reader
extend metaphor of going on a journey
also the ability to search for something
[[The Organization of My Digital Garden]]

Todo: start adding collected notes and writings

- [[Abundance Mindset]]
