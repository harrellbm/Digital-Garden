Aspen trees used to not mean much to me. I'd look out into the forest and see an unformed mass of green and brown. Yes, aspens were just another kind of tree. Until one day a memory was frozen into my sixteen year old brain. I was sixteen, old enough to be confident I understood the world, and young enough to believe it.  

I was on the epic adventure of boy scouting: backpacking in the back country of New Mexico up and down the mountains of the Philmont reservation. On this particular day, we had hiked from the early light of dawn until we saw the vague pillars of trees pass us by with the extinguishing of the sun. Finally, flashlights bobbed and dropped as we fumbled to set up out tents in the dark. As if the dark was not complicated enough, a cool stormy breeze began to blow. The exhausted frantic shuffle ensued to erect our tents before the coming rain. I remember zipping the tent's door as a boom of thunder echoed against the mountain's heavy sides. That night can only be described as breath taking. The rumbles shook the ground I laid on while the wind whipped the trees. 

I woke the next morning to the soft bubble of a stream I hadn't noticed the night before. As I emerged from my little burrow, I stepped into the middle of a perfectly untouched aspen grove. The calm completely captivated me. Cream trunks surrounded us in every direction with the little creek winding its way past. The light softly filtered through bright green leaves as if the storm the night before was only a dream. 

At that moment, aspen trees began to mean something to me.

# Connected by the Roots

Aspen trees are all connected by the roots. A grove is there for one big tree. 

This is my experiment in [[Digital Gardening]].

- iterative nature of them
- topological nature of them through links forming paths
- This is a different way of ‚ÄúBeing‚Äù in digital space compared to stream based spaces like email, social media or blogs

# Christian Collaboration
Pastors and churches have a hard time collaborating in meaningful and open ways.

We often get stuck in [[The Packaging Trap]] which is basically always trying to market a new curriculum, or book, or journal that should just be copy pasted into a new context. Which we all know does not work. Curriculums end up being more work than just doing something yourself most of the time. 

So the desire of this garden is to be a space to explore collaboration that is more fluid and immediately useful for myself but also to visitors who use this garden as a resource. 

There is nothing to sell or package or advertised, just a humble offering of ideas and concepts that are useful to me and maybe will be useful to someone else too.

Starting conversations is far more important that publishing yet another book.
